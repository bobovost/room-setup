PS Vita Review (PS Vita) Push Square From pushsquare.com
First appearance in a game: Mario is so big at this point that he is basically the unofficial face of gaming. Released a list of the top 50 video game. It’s incredibly dramatic, has some of most talented people voice acting in it, and none of the male characters in the main cast have any clue what being a person actually is.
