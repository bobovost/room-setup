This Is How Much Space The PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X Will Take Up From geekculture.co
The installation should occupy about 7.5 gb on the disk. Some playstation 5 games weigh up as much as 50% less than the ps4 versions. For the ps4 i would leave at least the same size as the biggest game, so if that was 150gb then i would always keep the last 150gb free on disk, but probably more like 200gb.
