<p>What i really like about the razer is the top notch components (gpu, cpu). Allot of people that i know think razer as a bad brand but is that really the truth. Razer's gaming laptops, including the blade , blade pro and blade stealth, are left wide open to attacks due to a critical security vulnerability. As for there laptops to be honest the last two times i was in the market i have been torn between razer laptops and alienware/sager but literally the only reason for any interest.</p>
