Razer BlackWidow Elite Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Razer Green From joelatplay.com
I&#39;ve played for 2 years with green switches on a blackwidow. Compact mechanical keyboard with razer chroma rgb. If you prefer the typing experience and feel, but also game, (my case, but i have all just for becauses.), go with greens. They feel very similar except the razer green switches actuation point is closer to the top, so the key triggers faster upon pressing, which is great for gaming.
